        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>We are trying to make a difference by taking
            kids out of school that are disrupting 
            the class and put them in schools that don't
            care if they disrupt the class and don't get
            consequences for their actions.</p>
        <p>This may sound
            strange but studies have shown that disruptive
            kids work better in disruptive environments
            and quiet kids work better in quiet environments.</p>
        <p>Our project was also named after an infamous case
            where a child, named Bob, would not stop being
            disruptive in class.</p>
